Multi-threaded and Out-of-core processing with Python
=====================================================

Jupyter Notebooks (for Python 3) that introduce the usage of [`dask`](http://dask.pydata.org) for processing
data larger than the memory available (out-of-core computing), dependancy resolution with `dask` graphs and
manipulation of numpy-style arrays with multipole cores (multi-threading).

See inside each notebook for a step-by-step detailed explanation of the content

## Requirements

Make sure to follow the step from the `rpi-setup.md` in this repository and then run the `0_setup` Notebook 
to create a random input dataset.
